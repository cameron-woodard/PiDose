# PiDose

PiDose is an open-source tool for long-term oral drug administration to mice. A 3D-printed chamber is mounted adjacent to a mouse home-cage, allowing animals free access 24 hours/day. Inside, they are individually identified by an implanted RFID capsule and are weighed by a load cell (on which the chamber is mounted). Mice learn to lick at a spout inside the chamber which delivers either water or drug solution depending on if they have received the correct drug dosage for the day.
